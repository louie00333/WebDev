My Summer project was building a circuit to interface with the HTC VIVE tracker. The initial requirements of the 
project were to have buttons that could take in user inputs, and transmit to the central processor. This was completed
relatively early in the internship.

Looking for a new challenge, I proposed to add a processing unit to expand the capabilities of the device.
This allowed for the introduction of a whole new range of features as well as challenges. Some additions include,
microcontroller focused PCB design, input timing measurement, varied complex outputs, microcontrolled motors, and developing custom C library.
